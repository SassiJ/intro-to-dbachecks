Introduction to Dbachecks

Dbachecks is a powershell module by and for DBAs and data professionals who are interested in automating their routine database checks. This module is a set of cmdlets built using the dbatools and pester modules that perform various standard checks on your databases - think of the kinds of checks you may be performing manually every single day, and how much time you could save if they were automated!

This session is for anyone who wants to automate their SQL database checks, regardless of experience.

In this session, we will learn what dbachecks can check, how to automate our routine database checks on our entire SQL estate, configure our checks to meet our organizations specific needs, and display the results in a PowerBI dashboard.

No prior PowerShell or PowerBI experience is required - just bring your curiosity and willingness to learn!
